# CMap Resources

This open source project provides the latest CMap resources for Adobe’s public character collections.

CMap (*Character Map*) resources are used to unidirectionally map character codes, such as a Unicode encoding form, to CIDs (*Characters IDs*, meaning glyphs) of a CIDFont resource. CMap resources, like CIDFont resources, include a /CIDSystemInfo dictionary that specifies /Registry and /Ordering strings that must match for compatibility between the two resources. In other words, a CMap resource can be used with a CIDFont resource only if their /Registry and /Ordering strings match.

A character collection is sometimes referred to as an **ROS**, which is an abbreviation for the three elements of the /CIDSystemInfo dictionary, specifically the **/Registry** string, the **/Ordering** string, and the **/Supplement** value (an integer). When fully specified, the three elements are separate using single hyphens, such as **Adobe-Japan1-7** (broken down into /Registry = *Adobe*, /Ordering = *Japan1*, and /Supplement = *7*).

Although originally designed for use with CIDFont resources, CMap resources are also used for other purposes, such as by the [AFDKO](https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/afdko) *makeotf* tool for building 'cmap' tables for OpenType/CFF fonts when the source font is a CIDFont resource.

## Contents

This project includes the following CMap resources, grouped by character collection:

*Adobe-Identity-0*: Adobe-Identity-0 (Special Purpose)  
*Adobe-CNS1-7*: [Adobe-CNS1-7](https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/Adobe-CNS1/) (Traditional Chinese, including Hong Kong SCS-2016)  
*Adobe-GB1-5*: [Adobe-GB1-5](https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/Adobe-GB1/) (Simplified Chinese)  
*Adobe-Japan1-7*: [Adobe-Japan1-7](https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/Adobe-Japan1/) (Japanese)  
*Adobe-Korea1-2*: [Adobe-Korea1-2](https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/Adobe-KR/raw/master/5093.Adobe-Korea1-2.pdf) (Korean)  
*Adobe-KR-9*: [Adobe-KR-9](https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/Adobe-KR/) (Korean)  
*deprecated/Adobe-Japan2-0*: [Adobe-Japan2-0](https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/Adobe-Japan1/raw/master/5097.Adobe-Japan2-0.pdf) (Japanese, for JIS X 0212-1990 only; Deprecated and replaced by Adobe-Japan1-6)

**Special Note**: With regard to Adobe-Japan1-7, only the CMap resources have been updated to support the character that will represent the two-kanji square ligature form of Japan’s forthcoming new era name, which is U+32FF. The actual specification will be updated shortly after the new era name is announced, which is expected to happen on 2019-04-01.

The *VERSIONS.txt* file specifies the current version of each CMap resource.

Each collection of CMap resources includes a *cid2code.txt* file that provides the mappings for each CID in tabular form. The Adobe-Japan1-7 CMap resources additionally include mapping files for the three JIS standards, JIS X 0208, JIS X 0212, and JIS X 0213, for JIS90- (*-jp90*) and JIS2004-savvy (*-jp04*) implementations. (The deprecated Adobe-Japan2-0 CMap resources include JIS X 0212 mapping files.)

## CMap Resources Versus 'cmap' Tables

CMap resources should not be confused with '[cmap](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/cmap)' tables of sfnt-based fonts, such as OpenType and TrueType. While they are functionally similar, in that both unidirectionally map character codes, a 'cmap' table maps them to GIDs (*Glyph IDs*). For some fonts, such as OpenType fonts that are based on one of these character collections and include every glyph, CIDs can equal GIDs, but it is not guaranteed, thus the importance of the distinction.

## Compiling/Decompiling CMap Resources

The [Perl Scripts](https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/perl-scripts) open source project includes a *cmap-tool.pl* script that can be used to compile and decompile CMap resources.

## CMap Resource Descriptions

The sections that follow provide detailed information about the CMap resources that are included in this project, on a per character collection basis, and the following conventions and notes apply:

* References to code points and code space ranges are expressed in hexadecimal notation, and use a leading “0x.”  
* Every two hexadecimal digits correspond to one byte.  
* The encodings described in this document range from one- to four-byte.  
* Whenever a horizontal CMap resource is modified to support a newer Supplement, its corresponding vertical CMap resource is also modified to reflect the same Supplement, regardless of whether mappings were added or not.  
* Although still listed, the UCS-2 CMap files are now considered obsolete, and are no longer being maintained. They have been replaced&mdash;for all character collections&mdash;with a suite of UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32 CMap resources that include the same number of mappings.
